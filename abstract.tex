Major software vulnerabilities in critical software has led to more interest in
formal verification of our software. One way that has presented itself to verify
our code is by using dependent types, an idea from the 1970s present in a number of
upcoming programming languages.

We present a study into the current state-of-the-art dependently-typed
programming languages. Idris was chosen as the tool to carry out this study. The
methodology involved carrying out case studies into applying dependent types to
real-world programming problems. An evaluation of the outcomes and the current
landscape of dependently-typed programming languages applied in a practical
sense is provided as a result of carrying out these case studies.
