\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Firstly, I would like to thank my parents for giving me the opportunity, support
and encouragement I needed throughout my degree.

\noindent
I would like to thank Glenn Strong for his continued guidance and suggestions
throughout this project as my supervisor.

\noindent
I would also like to thank the budding Idris and dependent type community,
particularly those in the \#idris IRC channel, for being patient enough to
answer any questions that I had.
