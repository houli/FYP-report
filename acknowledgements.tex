\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I'd firstly like to thank my parents for giving me the opportunity, support and
encouragement I needed throughout my degree.

I'd like to thank Glenn Strong for his continued guidance and suggestions
throughout this project as my supervisor.

I'd also like to thank the budding Idris and dependent type community,
particularly those in the \#idris IRC channel, for being patient enough to
answer any questions that I had.
